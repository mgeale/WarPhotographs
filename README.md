# Exhibition of War Photographs

### Taken by Capt. F. Hurley, August 1917- August 1918

A few months after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 an exhibition took place in Sydney showcasing the photography of Capt. Frank Hurley, an official war photographer for the Australian Imperial Forces.

Titled 'Exhibition of War Photographs', it was held at <i>The Kodak Salon</i>, George St. Sydney, in the early months of 1919.

In this web app I have tried to present the exhibition's photos in the easy to view format, using modern web technologies.
